Using command nc challenge.ctf.games 30351 in terminal results:

root@kali:~# nc challenge.ctf.games 30351
Oh, we already sent the flag! Did you see it?

After trying a couple of more tricks using pipe results:

root@kali:~# nc challenge.ctf.games 30351 | cat 
Oh, we already sent the flag! Did you see it?
root@kali:~# nc challenge.ctf.games 30351 | echo

root@kali:~#

No result obtained. But with command " nc challenge.ctf.games 30351 | less " results in a vim editor with data:

f^Ml^Ma^Mg^M{^Mt^Mh^Mi^Ms^M_^Mn^Me^Mt^Mc^Ma^Mt^M_^Ms^Ma^My^Ms^M_^Mm^Me^Mo^Mw^M}^MOh, we already sent the flag! Did you see it?

After removing "^M" flag obtained:

flag{this_netcat_says_meow}
