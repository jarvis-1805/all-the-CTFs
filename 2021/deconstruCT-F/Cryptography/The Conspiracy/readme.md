The Conspiracy

Cyptography
There was once a sailor who travelled to many countries. He was a quirky old man. He said many many things, and most of what he said never made sense to anyone. He considered himself ahead of his time, and said that the people of his time were unworthy of his wisdom. Soon he was lost to the ages, but his diary wasn't. Are you worthy of decoding his wisdom?
