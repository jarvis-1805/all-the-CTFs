Using the inspect element tool first we found a flag in the comments of the page:
dsc{th15_15_n0t_th3_fl4g}
But this is not the corect flag
Lets see the source code of this page, there's a js file and a css file.

Viewing the js file shows the message:
// aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1kUXc0dzlXZ1hjUQ
// since this a warmup, i'll let you know that this is base64 encoded
// and you should check the yt comments of the decoded link

Upon decrypting the above message, link found was:
https://www.youtube.com/watch>v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
Converting the link to:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
So this was a rickroll.

Lets see the css file, here we see an interesting class:
.contain-flag::after {
  z-index: -64209;
  caesar-cipher: +3;
  flag: "gvf{zh0frph_wr_ghfrqvwuxfwi}";
}
So lets perform ceaser-cipher with key +3, and we found the flag:
dsc{welcome_to_deconstructf}
